            <blockquote>
                The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
                inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed
                is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the
                weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his
                brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will
                strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger
                those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you
                will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.
