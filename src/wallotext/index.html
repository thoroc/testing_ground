                First of all, you have no idea what you're talking about. It is clearly the advantages of random text that make
                the internet so distinctive from other crappy text that I', ad libbing specifically for this nonsensical paragraph.
                Second of all, pointing out my poor grammar is weak like Bush's approval ratings, even though history will
                clearly show that he was among the best presidents of the US has ever had. A badger just humped my leg. Can
                you believe this crap? Those bastards needs to be put in front of a speeding train. I stalled a bit there, but I
                will keep on writing a block of text, so that it may appear as if I have a good point to make you shall be over-
                whelmed by my return-key-ignoring skills, Resistance is futile! And then, when you attempt to reply to it, you
                will inevitably neglect some points that I may have made. I shall point this out to you in a lame-ass effort to
                appear more intellectual and, thus, right. You are lucky that I'm using commas, even though I firmly believe in
                capital punishment. You feebly mind cannot begin to comprehend the massive skill and patience that it takes
                to abid a big-ass wall o' text that you see before you. I would be trully impressed if you have made it this far
                and, as you can see, you are not even half-way through! You poor shoul. Aviator sunglasses is where i's at.
                Where what is at? And how can something be at sunglasses? wtf does that mean? Unless we're taling about
                microbes, then nothing else would be fitting. You can't be "at" something of that size! Even those big-ass Paris
                Hilton sunglasses taht can cause nuclear winter by blocking the sun. Really, NASA was planning on bringing a
                pair to shield the space station. But then their toilet broke and they were like "bah fuck that." Speaking of fuck
                that, am I the only on who thinks that today's music suck ass? I mean I saw some chick singing and I was
                about to pour motor oil in my ears. Where is today's good music like Boston, AC/DC, or Led Zeppelin? What
                will be considered today's classic 20 years from now? Oh yea, the world ends in 2012 so it doesn't even matter.
                What's that? Ah yes the mayans were the shiznit astronomers. As fat as astronomy goes, the mayans is where
                is at, yo! They knew that every 20,000 years, the Earth and the sun line up with the center of the Milky Way.
                How the hell do you figure that out? That's badass. Probably the aliens taought them. But what kind of stupid
                aliens would teach that? Seriously? Wouldn't they teach something USEFUL like how to make a block HEMI
                with a supercharger? That would've hauled ass back then! But no, instead they taught them how to figure out
                when shit lines up in the sky. And so, tic-tac-toe was born. Line up the stars, bitches! The return key feels
                extremely neglected by now. It misses the touch of my right pinky! Shadow of the Colossus for the PS2 is a
                bad-ass game. I recommend it. I'm listening to the soundtrack right now! Bioshock is also the shit, as well as
                Half Life 2. Anyone who disagrees with this is a vegetarian. And apparently there is something even further
                than that, people who only eat fruits. I forgot the name but I'm astonished that they exist! More power to them
                and their leather belt. You're still reading? wow, you get some sort of prize. Like a granola bar or something.
                How about a gum? You like gum? Icebreakers is where ti's at... where the mint is at. Oh, snap! Alright this is the
                last few lines so let's make it sound serious. The democrats have undoubtedly put this country in the toilet in
                the short 2 years that they've been in power of Congress! Not to mention that things can indeed go down that
                fast and don't need years to build up, which is what a bubble is! Your shortsightendness is typical of a liberal
                pinko commie and you are destroying America with your tolerance for different people, ya hippie! If you don't
                like it, then you can get out and go to go Canada to munch on some Canadian beacon, EH EH! This is our country
                and we will nuke whoever messes with us! USA NUMBER ONE! Corporation ftw, yo!
