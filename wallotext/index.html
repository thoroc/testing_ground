                First of all, you have no idea what you're talking about. It is clearly the advantages of random text that make
                the internet so distinctive from other crappy text that I', ad libbing specifically for this nonsensical paragraph.
                Second of all, pointing out my poor grammar is weak like Bush's approval ratings, even though history will
                clearly show that he was among the best presidents of the US has ever had. A badger just humped my leg. Can
                you believe this crap? Those bastards needs to be put in front of a speeding train. I stalled a bit there, but O
                will keep on writing a block of text, so that it may appear as if I have a good point to make you shall be over-
                whelmed by my return-key-ignoring skills, Resistance is futile! And then, when you attempt to reply to it, you
                will inevitably neglect some points that I may have made. I shall point this out to you in a lame-ass effort to
                appear more intellectual and, thus, right. You are lucky that I'm using commas, even though I firmly believe in
                capital punishment. You feebly mind cannot begin to comprehend the massive skill and patience that it takes
                to abid a big-ass wall o' text that you see before you. I would be trully impressed if you have made it this far
                and, as you can see, you are not even half-way through! You poor shoul. Aviator sunglasses is where i's at.
                Where what is at? And how can something be at sunglasses? wtf does that mean? Unless we're taling about
                microbes, then nothing else would be fitting. You can't be "at" something of that size! Even those big-ass Paris
                Hilton sunglasses taht can cause nuclear winter by blocking the sun. Really, NASA was planning on bringing a
                pair to shield the space station. But then their toilet broke and they were like "bah fuck that." Speaking of fuck
                that, am I the only on who thinks that today's music suck ass? I mean I saw some chick singing and I was
                about to pour motor oil in my ears. Where is today's good music like Boston, AC/DC, or Led Zeppelin?
