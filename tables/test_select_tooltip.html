        <div class="hidden apple">
            The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree, species Malus
            domestica in the rose family (Rosaceae). It is one of the most widely
            cultivated tree fruits, and the most widely known of the many members
            of genus Malus that are used by humans. Apples grow on small, deciduous
            trees. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
            Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for
            thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North
            America by European colonists. Apples have been present in the
            mythology and religions of many cultures, including Norse, Greek and
            Christian traditions. In 2010, the fruit's genome was decoded,
            leading to new understandings of disease control and selective
            breeding in apple production.</br>
            There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a
            range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for
            various tastes and uses, including cooking, fresh eating and cider
            production. Domestic apples are generally propagated by grafting,
            although wild apples grow readily from seed. Trees are prone to a
            number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be
            controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means.</br>
            About 69 million tonnes of apples were grown worldwide in 2010, and
            China produced almost half of this total. The United States is the
            second-leading producer, with more than 6% of world production.
            Turkey is third, followed by Italy, India and Poland. Apples are
            often eaten raw, but can also be found in many prepared foods
            (especially desserts) and drinks. Many beneficial health effects are
            thought to result from eating apples; however, two forms of
            allergies are seen to various proteins found in the fruit.

        <div class="hidden peach">
            The peach, Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree, native to China and
            South Asia, where it was first cultivated. It bears an edible juicy
            fruit also called a peach. The species name persica refers to its
            widespread cultivation in Persia, whence it was transplanted to
            Europe. It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry
            and plum, in the family Rosaceae. The peach is classified with the
            almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other
            subgenera by the corrugated seed shell.</br>
            Peaches and nectarines are the same species, even though they are
            regarded commercially as different fruits. Nectarines have an
            orange center and faint fuzz, while peaches have white centers and
            very fuzzy skin; genetic studies suggest nectarines are produced due
            to a recessive allele, whereas peaches are produced from dominant
            allele for fuzzy skin.[2]</br>
            China is the world's largest producer of peaches and nectarines.

        <div class="hidden banana">
            A banana is an edible fruit produced by several kinds of large
            herbaceous flowering plants of the genus Musa.[1] (In some countries,
            bananas used for cooking may be called plantains.) The fruit is
            variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and
            curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which
            may be yellow, purple or red when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters
            hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible
            parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species –
            Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most
            cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa ×
            paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending
            on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name Musa
            sapientum is no longer used.</br>
            Musa species are native to tropical South and Southeast Asia, and
            are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea.[2][3]
            They are grown in at least 107 countries,[4] primarily for their
            fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine and as
            ornamental plants. In 2013 bananas were fourth among the main world
            food crops (after rice, wheat and maize) in financial value.[5]
            Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between "bananas" and
            "plantains". </br>
            Especially in the Americas and Europe, "banana" usually refers to
            soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the Cavendish
            group, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries.
            By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called
            "plantains". In other regions, such as Southeast Asia, many more
            kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the simple two-fold
            distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.</br>
            The term "banana" is also used as the common name for the plants
            which produce the fruit.[1] This can extend to other members of the
            genus Musa like the scarlet banana (Musa coccinea), pink banana
            (Musa velutina) and the Fe'i bananas. It can also refer to members
            of the genus Ensete, like the snow banana (Ensete glaucum) and the
            economically important false banana (Ensete ventricosum). Both
            genera are classified under the banana family, Musaceae.</br>
