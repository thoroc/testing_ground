testing_ground
==============

really just to play around with html/js/css


different project bundled into one for convenience sake.

Things tried among others:

* d3.js
* jquery for customizing filter drop down
* polymaps.js for creating a map for DayZ
* skyrim for relationship

And some more random testing
